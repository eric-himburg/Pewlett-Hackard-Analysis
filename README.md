# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
In order to ensure the seemless operation of a large corporation, the number of current employees retiring in the near future was determined.  Additionally, the future retirees were grouped by job title to see the amount of losses each position would incur, but also to determine how many potential retirees could act as mentors for younger company employees.  The number of employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program was also tabulated to see how many current employees would be availabe to fill the retirement positions.    

Data from the corporation was originally kept in CSV files and read using EXCEL.  These CSV files were uploaded into a Postgres database, where the data was linked together and queried to generate an assortement of data tables.  As discussed below, database queries quickly determined the number of retirees, which ones would make suitable mentors, and the number of junior employees availabe to be mentored.

## Results
* The majority of upcoming retirees have senior level positions.  
A "retirement titles" table that holds all the titles of employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 was created.  A sample of the table can be seen in the image below.  Only the most recent title of current employees was included in the table.
